## This is the frontend repo of a two-repo project for a decentralized Virtual Proxy Network
# Please see https://github.com/dProxSocks/kubo-socks for the "backend" details. 

# üèó Scaffold-ETH 2

The frontend is built using <a href="https://scaffoldeth.io">Scaffold-ETH 2</a>. It's an open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain, using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, and Typescript.

Other key technologies used are: 
# Unlock Protocol 
1. Hosts with internet access, like an AirBnB host, may access "rent" out their internet access as membership/time based NFTs generated by the Unlock's Smart Contract.
2. A user with a valid NFT may access the proxy through the given node ID provided by libp2p, thus allowing the world to see only the IP address associated with the given node ID and not the user's actual IP.
3. To enhance the user's identity and privacy, we had planned to leverage @Lit Protocol, with the condition of a valid NFT (Based on Unlock), as a public key infrastructure (PKI) support the tunnel to encrypt and decrypt the content and data, including user identity, being transmitted.

# The Graph
We deployed a new subgraph (The Graph) of the all the available nodes for users to choose from.


## Future Implementation
- we plan to integrate it with [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/#setting-up-your-own-certificate-authority-ca-and-generating-certificates-and-keys-for-an-openvpn-server-and-multiple-clients) and substitute its existing public key infrastructure (PKI) with [Lit Protocol](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v2/resources/howitworks/) to make this a true VPN service
- Add a calculation checker for node host know how much traffic they have left so they can control how many access they can handle
- Enrich the network by enabling the node hosts to form DAOs
    - Allow a network of host to develop a decentralized Content Delivery Network (dCDN)
- Ensure the quality of user and avoid any abuse or unlawful use of the network by using @DID and Z-K to verify the user's online online trustworthiness
- Allow Account Abstraction for hosts to further classify users
- Create a Real-Time pricing view for people to know the cost of access and usage
